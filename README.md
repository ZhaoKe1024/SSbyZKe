SS Algorithm for Java

This project includes differential evolution algorithm and sparrow search algorithm. Among them, there is numpy4j library, which is a scientific computing toolbox imitating MATLAB and python.
这个工程包含了差分进化算法和麻雀搜索算法。其中还有本人靠自己编写的numpy4J库，它是模仿MATLAB和Python的科学计算工具箱。

However, this code is not computationally correct, because I used sphere to test the function, but I used Rosenbrock function to test the result is very wrong, which shows that the code is not universal for functions of different complexity. But the algorithm flow is correct. I doubt that there is something wrong with the function.
但是，这是个计算不正确的代码，因为我使用Sphere测试函数结果正确，但是我使用RosenBrock函数进行测试结果非常错误，说明代码对于不同复杂性的函数不具有普适性。但是其中算法流程却是正确的，我怀疑函数编写有问题。
